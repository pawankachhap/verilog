# 32-bit RISC processor
## Pipeline Implementation

A 32-bit pipelined ***RISC processor*** is implemented using *Verilog* behavioural design methodology.

Processor file : *pipe_MIPS32.v*

Compilation and simulation is done using Icarus Verilog
* To compile the code :
    `iverilog -o <output-file> <source-file>`

* For Windows Users to simulate the compiled file :
    `vvp <output-file>`

* An output file is provided named ./out which can be directly simulated

**Tools used**
* Icarus-Verilog
* GTKWAVE
* Visual Studio Code (with verilog extension)
